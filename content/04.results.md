### Creation of an Annotated News Dataset

We have analyzed the text and citations of 22,094 news-related articles hosted on "www.nature.com".
The articles span 15 years from 2005-2020, and seven article types: Career Column, Career Feature, News, News and Views, News Feature, Technology Feature, and Toolbox.
The text and citations were then uniformly processed as depicted in Figure @fig:fig1 a.
We scraped the text using the web-crawling framework Scrapy [@https://scrapy.org/], processed, and run through the coreNLP pipeline ([Methods]).
From the coreNLP pipeline results, we wanted to identify two distinct data types to analyze, country mentions and quotes with their associated speakers.
To identify country mentions, we used the following named entities as possible mentions: "organizations", "countries", "states or provinces".
We then mapped the named entity to a country prediction using OpenStreetMap [@https://www.openstreetmap.org].
To identify quotes and speakers, we used the coreNLP quote extraction and attribution annotator.
We performed name normalization ([Methods]) to identify the speaker’s full name for gender and name origin prediction.
We scraped the citations using an independent scraper to the text scraper.
All identified DOI's were queried using the Springer API to attain author names, positions, and affiliations.


We used the author names, positions, and affiliations of Research articles and Letters published by Nature to perform comparative analyses.
Since the news articles of current science, the quoted speakers, mentioned countries, and cited authors should have a similar demographic makeup to contemporaneous Nature authorship.
The author metadata of research-related articles was analyzed over the same period as the news-related articles and totaled 13,414 articles.
Since the demographic makeup of authors published in Nature may not represent overall science authorship, we also analyzed 36,000 randomly selected articles from English language journals over the same time.
The extracted author affiliations from both data sources were mapped to a country using OpenStreetMap.
Similarly, author names were uniformly processed and then used to predict both gender and name origin.

When considering all Nature articles, news and research, across all time, we find significant variability in the number of articles by type (Figure @fig:fig1 b).
The top three observed article frequencies are research (including letters and research), news, and news-and-views.
Since Nature merged letters and research articles in 2019, we combine them in our analysis.
The changing classification of article types may also explain temporal changes in news articles.
Over time, the frequency of news-related articles is decreasing; however, more specific article types are increasing.
We observe this in the introduction of two new categories, "Career-column" and "Career-feature" in 2016.
These articles were previously identified as "News" articles before 2016, as exemplified in the article "XX" [EXAMPLE].

### Quoted Speakers are More Often Male

![
**Male bias is observed in news quotes but is dependent on article type**
Panel A, left, depicts an example of the names extracted from quoted speakers in news articles and authors in research articles.
Panel A, right, highlighted the data types and processes used to analyze the gender of extracted names.
Panel B shows an overview of the number of quotes extracted for each article type.
Panel C depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of quotes for an estimated male speaker; Light Blue: Proportion of first author articles from an estimated male author; Dark Blue: Proportion of last author articles from an estimated male author.
We observe that the proportion of estimated male quotes is steadily decreasing, most notably from 2017 onward.
This decreasing trend is not due to a change in quotes from the first or last authors, as observed in Panel D.
Panel D shows a consistent but slight bias towards quoting the last author of a cited article than the first author.
Instead, the observed downward trend of male quotes coincides with additional article types introduced in 2017.
Panel E depicts the frequency of quote by article type highlighting an increase in quotes from “Career-Feature” articles.
Panel E depicts that the quotes obtained in this article type have reached parity.
The colored bands represent a 95% confidence interval in all plots, and the point is the median calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

To quantify the amount of gender bias in quotes, we analyzed the names of quoted speakers and compared them against the first and last authors of research articles.
While we could have analyzed the proportion of all quotes from a male speaker, we were interested in measuring the overall participation rates by gender.
Figure @fig:fig2 shows an overview of the process and example input data for this analysis.
This analysis relies upon accurate gender prediction of both authors and speakers.
To predict the gender of the speaker or author, we used the package genderizeR [@https://github.com/kalimu/genderizeR], an R package wrapper to access the genderize.io API [@https://genderize.io/] to get binary gender predictions for each identified first name.
We, unfortunately, cannot identify non-binary gender expression with the tools we used.
To identify our binary gender prediction error rate, we created a benchmark data set of thirty randomly selected news articles; ten from each of the following years: 2005, 2010, 2015.
In these articles, we hand-annotated the quoted speakers and their assumed gender.
We then compared our hand-annotated gender prediction against the gender prediction after the entire scraping, coreNLP quote annotator, and genderizeR pipeline.
Using our hand-annotated prediction as ground truth, we predicted a total of 55 female and 155 male observed names within the benchmark articles.
We found that the gender prediction had an accuracy of 0.914, with a Kappa statistic of 0.767 (Supplemental Figure 1 a).
After establishing a reasonable accuracy for gender prediction, we determined the rate of gendered quotes within articles.
We first examined the number of quotes identified within each news-related article (Figure @fig:fig2 b), totaling 120,309 quotes with a gender prediction for the speaker.
Quote frequencies vary by article type.
The only article types in which there is a large discrepancy between the number of quotes and articles are "news-and-views" and "career-column.”
This discrepancy is expected in "news-and-views" since this article type typically is an overview of a specific scientific topic and rarely quotes authors.
Similarly, "career-column" is a perspective piece from a scientist who also rarely quotes other persons.

We then compared the number of male quotes to the number of male first and last authors published in Nature (Figure @fig:fig2 c).
We analyzed a total of 10466 first authors and 10494 last authors with a gender prediction.
As denoted by the red line, we find that both authorship and quotes are far from gender parity.
Additionally, we find a difference in author genders between first and last authors, with the last authors being more male-dominated.
Since Nature authorship may not represent scientific publishing as a whole, we also compared against a random selection of authors from English language journals published by Springer (Supplemental Figure 2 a).
We observed a larger gender gap between first and last authors in our selection of Springer articles; however, both first and last authors are much closer to parity than Nature authors.


In contrast to the relatively stable gender proportions of authorship, we find the rate of male quotes significantly decreases over time.
The male quote rate in 2005 is 87.6% (884/7103) and in 2020 is 70.1% (3911/5578).
From 2005-2010, we find the male quote rate is higher than the male last authorship rate, then slowly decreasing until it matches the male first authorship rate in 2018 and continues to trend downwards.
We then explored the possible reasons for this decrease.
First, we looked at changes in the rate of authorship position by quoted speakers (Figure @fig:fig2 d).
We were able to identify 10167 quotes with an associated citation (4630 first author and 5537 last author quotes).
We found that quotes are slightly biased towards the last authors. 
However, this rate does not change over time, and we do not believe this drives the downward trend.
We then analyzed the breakdown of gendered quotes by article type.
Interestingly, we found one article type, "career-feature" that has achieved gender parity in its quotes (Figure @fig:fig2 e and Supplemental Figure 2 b).
Since the introduction of this article, it has identified a total of 1550 quotes and has substantially pulled the overall quote gender ratio much closer to parity from 2018 onward.

### Celtic English Names are over enriched in cited and quoted persons, while East Asian Names are under enriched

**Analysis of Quotes and Citations found Overrepresentation of Celtic/English and underrepresentation of East Asian names**
Panel A, left, depicts an example of the names extracted from quoted speakers and citations found within news articles and authors in research articles.
Panel A, right, highlights the data types and processes used to analyze the origin of extracted names.
Panels B and D depicts nine trend lines, each representing a possible name origin.
Panels C and E depict two possible trend lines, comparing either cited last authors or quoted speakers against last authors of Nature research articles.
We observed that the overrepresentation of Celtic/English names is present both in citations and quotes.
Furthermore, the overrepresentation of East Asian names is also present both in citations and quotes.
We recapitulate this finding when comparing against an additional background of Springer published last authors (Supplemental Figure XX)
](https://github.com/nrosed/nature_news_disparities/raw/09df81eac6d8450127552f0b9dd3a6c1212b10eb/figure_notebooks/tmp_files/fig3_tmp/fig3_main.png "Figure 3"){#fig:fig3 width=6in}


To identify possible bias in name origin, we again used the extracted quoted speakers and last authors published in Nature.
In addition, we also identified the last authors of all articles cited by a news-related article.
All processed names were then inputted into Wiki2019-LSTM and used to assign one of nine possible name origins ([Methods]).
Figure @fig:fig3 a displays a schematic of the data processing and example names used in this analysis.
We divided our analysis into two parts: firstly, looking at the number of cited last authors with a specific name origin overall cited last authors in a particular year.
Secondly, looking at the proportion of quotes from a speaker with a specific name origin overall quotes in a particular year.
We used the proportion of last authors in Nature with a specific name origin overall Nature articles in a particular year for both analyses.
Additionally, in our supplemental analyses, we compare against the last authorship in a random selection of Springer articles.
We find that the number of quotes dramatically outnumbers the number of authors and citations (Supplemental Figure 3 a).
Still, the total number of observations per data type is larger than [XX] across all years.

In comparing the citation rate of last author name origins in news articles, we find most names are Celtic/English or European, both with a citation rate between 30-40% [MORE SPECIFIC] (Figure @fig:fig3 b).
East Asian names are the highest proportion of cited names, with 10-20% cited last authorships [MORE SPECIFIC].
All other name origins make up less than 10% [MORE SPECIFIC] of total cited authors.
To compare against the composition of the last authors in Nature, we compare the top three most frequent name origins (Figure @fig:fig3 c).
We find a slight over-enrichment for Celtic/English names and a small under-enrichment for East Asian names.
Furthermore, we find no significant difference for European or other name origins (Figure @fig:fig3 c, Supplemental Figure 3 b).
We also observed the Celtic/English over-enrichment and East Asian under-enrichment when considering our subset of Springer articles (Supplemental Figure 3 c).
However, we also see a significant difference in European names, with a growing over-enrichment.
Additionally, we see a significant difference in Arabic/Turkish/Persian, Hispanic, Jewish, and South Asian name frequencies between cited authors and Springer authors, however, at a lower rate than observed for Celtic/English and East Asian.
We then sought to see if quoted speaker replicated the cited authors’ over- and under-enrichment patterns.
We found a much stronger Celtic/English over-enrichment, with quotes from Celtic/English speakers at a much higher frequency than quotes from European speakers (Figure @fig:fig3 c).
Additionally, we also found a much stronger under-enrichment of quotes from East Asian speakers (Figure @fig:fig3 c), with less than 10% of quotes compared to between 10-20% of cited authors in the same set of articles.
When we again compare against last authorship in Nature, we find the same patterns observed in the previously described citation analysis with all name origins except for East Asian and Celtic/English closely matching the background rate.
Similarly, we find the same patterns in quoted speakers when comparing against the Springer background as we did in the previous citation analysis (Supplemental Figure 3 e).


### Content of Science Coverage Differs between Countries

After finding name origin differences between cited and quoted persons, we wanted to determine if news articles 1) represent countries at different rates 2) vary in the language used to describe scientific content related to each country.
To do this analysis, we used three sources of information 1) country-related entities mentioned in the news text, 2) country affiliations of cited authors in news articles, 3) country affiliation of authors in Nature and Springer.
Figure @fig:fig4 a shows example input data and a schematic of the analysis.
We provide further processing details in [Methods].
First, we interrogated the country affiliations of cited authors.
We assigned an affiliation to a manuscript if any author has affiliation from a specific country. 
Therefore a single manuscript may have multiple country affiliations.
We analyzed any possible country affiliation for an article due to limits imposed by the Springer API.
Affiliation query results from the Springer API return all country affiliations for a specific manuscript and are not linked to one particular author.
 
We analyzed a total of XX articles and considered all authors within the article and their affiliations for this analysis.
We found that most cited articles have at least one author with an affiliation within the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and France (Figure @fig:fig4 b).
Interestingly, we found a strong citation over-enrichment of many top-cited countries, but we found no evidence of under-enrichment by East Asian countries (Figure @fig:fig4 c, Supplemental Figure 4 a).
Next, we examined content differences between countries or groups of countries.
For example, we wanted to determine the extent to which a country was the subject (i.e., their scientific policies, environment, pollution) or the research being performed within that country was the subject.
To do this, we need to calculate the mention rate of each country.
To identify if a country was mentioned in an article, we started with all organizations, countries, states, or provinces identified by coreNLP's named entity tagger.
We then linked all the identified region-related named entities to countries with OpenStreetMap.
Since there may be errors in both coreNLP and OpenStreetMap, we only assumed a country was mentioned when at least two unique entities mapped to the same country in a single article.
On a benchmark set, this results in a class-balanced error of [XX] across all countries (Supplemental Figure 1 b).
 
 
Once we calculated the mention rate and used the previously described citation rate, we identified countries with a consistent skew towards either a higher or lower mention to citation rate (Figure @fig:fig4 d and Supplemental Figure 4 b).
This is defined as countries where the difference between citation and mention rates is in the top or bottom 5% per year.
This outlier description allowed us to identify two sets of countries based on their citation and mention rates.
Those with a high relative citation to mention rate were: Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Spain, Denmark, Israel, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, China, South Korea, and Australia.
Those with a low relative citation to mention rate: Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Brasil, Philippines, Colombia,  and India.
We removed all countries that were in both the top or bottom 5% in different years, which excluded the United States and the United Kingdom from consideration. [List all of them]
 
We then identified content differences between these two sets of countries by analyzing all of the main text from articles that mentioned and did not cite an author affiliated with each of the specified countries.
After properly identifying high-frequency words across the entire corpus, we identified the top 15 most discriminative terms of each country type ([Methods]).
Interestingly, we identified that the top 15 words most representative of countries mentioned more were closely related to environmental topics.
The top 5 terms were rainforest, pesticide, dams, plantations, and deforestation (Figure @fig:fig4 e, Supplemental Figure 4 c and d).
In contrast, we find that the top 5 words most related to countries with a higher citation than mention rate were associated with biological or medical terms.
The top five terms were Parkinson’s, classical, epigenetic, mitochondrial, and yeast.
