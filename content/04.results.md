### Data Collected
We have analyzed the text and citations of 22,094 news-related articles hosted on "www.nature.com".
The articles span 15 years from 2005-2020, and seven article types: Career Column, Career Feature, News, News and Views, News Feature, Technology Feature, Toolbox.
The text and citations were then uniformly processed as depicted in Figure @fig:fig1 a.
The text was scraped using the web-crawling framework Scrapy [@https://scrapy.org/], processed, and run through the coreNLP pipeline [Methods].
From the coreNLP pipeline results, we wanted to identify two separate types of data to analyze, country mentions and quotes with their associated speakers.
To identify country mentions we used the following named entities as possible mentions: "organizations", "countries", "states or provinces".
We then mapped the named entity to a country prediction using Open Street Map [CITE]. 
To identify quotes and speakers, we used the coreNLP quote extraction and attribution annotator.
Name normalization [Methods] was performed in order to identify the full name of the speaker for gender and name origin prediction.
The citations were scraped using a scraper independent of the text scraper.
All identified DOI's were then queried using the Springer API to attain author names, positions, and affiliations.


In order to perform comparative analyses, we used the author names, positions, and affiliations of Research articles and Letters published by Nature.
We believe that since the news articles pertain to current science, the quoted speakers, mentioned countries, and cited authors should have a similar demographic make-up to contemporaneuous Nature authorship.
The author metadata of research-related articles were analyzed over the same time period as the news-related articles and totaled to 13,414 articles.
Since the demographic make-up of authors published in Nature may not be representative of overall science authorship, we additionally analyzed 36,000 randomly selected articles from english language journals over the same time period.
The extracted author affiliations from both data sources were mapped to a country using Open Street map.
Similarly, author names were uniformly processed and then used to predict both gender and name origin.

When considering all Nature articles, news and research, across all time, we find a great variability on number of articles by type (Figure @fig:fig1 b).
The top three observed article frequencies are, research (which indlues both letters and research), news, and news-and-views.
In our analysis, we combine both letters and research articles together because letters were merged into research articles in 2019.
The changing classification of article types may also explain temporal changes in news articles.
Over time, the frequency of news-related articles is decreasing, however more specific article types are increasing.
This is observed in the introduction of two new categories "Career-column" and "Career-feature" in 2016.
These articles were previously identified as "News" articles before 2016, as exemplified in the article "XX" [EXAMPLE].

### Gender Disparity Oberseved in Quotes

![
**Male bias is observed in news quotes, but is dependent on article type**
Panel A, left, depicts an example of the names extracted from quoted speakers in news articles and authors in research articles.
Panel A, right, highlights the data types and processed used to analyze the gender of extracted names.
Panel B shows and overview of the number of quotes extracted for each article type.
Panel C depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of quotes for an estimated male speaker; Light Blue: Proportion of first author articles from an estimated male author; Dark Blue: Proportion of last author articles from an estimated male author.
We observe that the proportion of estimated male quotes is steadily decreasing most notably from 2017 onward.
This trend is decreasing is not due to a change quotes coming from first or last authors, as observed in Panel D.
Panel D shows that there is a consistent, but slight bias towards quoting the last author of a cited article than the first author.
Instead, the observed downward trend of male quotes coincides with additional article types introduced in 2017.
Panel E depicts the frequency of quote by article type highlighting an increase in quotes from “Career-Feature” articles.
Panel E clearly depicts that the quotes obtained in this article type have reached parity.
In all plots the colored bands represent a 95% confidence interval and the point is the median calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

To quantify the amount of gender bias in quotes, we analyzed the names of quoted speakers and compared them against first and last authors of research articles.
An overview of the process and example input data for this analysis is shown in Figure @fig:fig2 a.
This analysis relies upn accurate gender prediction of both authors and speakers.
To predict the gender of the speaker or author, we used the package genderizeR [CITE] a R package wrapper to access the genderize.io API [CITE] to get binary gender predictions for each identified first name.
We unfortunately do not have the ability to identify non-binary gender expression with the tools we used.
To identify the error rate of our binary gender prediction, we created a benchmark data set of thirty randomly selected news articles; ten from each of the following years: 2005, 2010, 2015.
In these articles, we hand-annotated the quoted speakers and their assumed gender.
We then compared our hand-annotated gender prediction against the gender prediction after the entire scraping, coreNLP quote annotator, and genderizeR pipeline.
Using our hand-annotated prediction as the ground truth, we predicted a total of 55 female and 155 male observed names within the benchmark articles.
We found that the gender prediction had an accuracy of 0.914, with a Kappa statistic of 0.767 (Supplemental Figure 1a).

Now that we have established reasonable accuracy for our gender prediction, we went forward with establishing the rate of gendered quotes within articles.
We first looked at the amount of quotes identified within each news-related article (Figure @fig:fig2 b), totaling in 120,309 quotes with a gender prediction for the speaker.
Similarly to the differences in the number of articles by type, we similarly see this reflected in the number of quotes.
The only article types in which there is a large discrepancy between the number of quotes and articles is "news-and-views" and "career-column".
For "news-and-views", this is expected since this article type typically is an overview of a specific scientific topic and rarely quotes authors.
Similarly, "career-column" is a perspective piece from a scientist which also rarely quotes other persons.

We then compared the number of male quotes to the number of male first and last authors published in Nature (Figure @fig:fig2 c).
We analyzed a total of 10466 first authors and 10494 last authors with a gender prediction.
As denoted by the red line, we find that both authorship and quotes are far from gender parity.
Additionally, we find that there is a diffence in author genders between first and last authors, with last authors being more male dominated.
Since Nature authorship may not be representative of scientific publishing as a whole, we also compared against a random selection of authors from english language journals published by Springer (Supplemental Figure 2a).
We observed a larger gender gap between first and last authors in our selection of Springer articles, however both first and last authors are much closer to parity than Nature authors.

In contrast the the relatively stable gender proportions of authorship, we find the the rate of male quotes significantly decreases over time.
The male quote rate in 2005 is 87.6% (884/7103) and in 2020 is 70.1% (3911/5578).
From 2005-2010, we find the the male quote rate is higher than the male last authorship rate, then slowly decreasing until it matches the male first authorship rate in 2018 and continues to trend downwards.
We then explored what the possible reasons for this decrease.
First we looked at changes in the rate of authorship position by quoted speakers (Figure @fig:fig2 d).
We were able to identify 10167 quotes with an associated citation (4630 first author and 5537 last author quotes).
We found that quotes are slightly biased towards last authors, however this rate does not change over time and we do not believe this drives the downward trend.
We then analyzed the breakdown of gendered quotes by article type.
Interestingly, we found one article type, "career-feature" that has acheived gender parity in its quotes (Figure @fig:fig2 e and Supplemental Figure 2b).
Since this articles introduction, it has identified a total of 1550 quotes, and has substantially pulled the overall quote gender ratio much closer to parity from 2018 onward.

### Celtic English Names are over enriched in cited and quoted persons, while East Asian Names are under enriched  

![
**Overrepresentation of Celtic/English names and underrepresentation of East Asian names is found in both Quotes and Citations**
Panel A, left, depicts an example of the names extracted from quoted speakers and citations found within news articles, as well as authors in research articles.
Panel A, right, highlights the data types and processed used to analyze the origin of extracted names.
Panels B and D depicts nine trend lines, each representing a possible name origin.
Panels C and E depicts two possible trend lines, comparing  either cited last authors or quoted speakers against last authors of Nature research articles.
We observed that the overrepresentation of Celtic/English names is present both in citations and quotes.
Furthermore, the overrepresentation of East Asian names is also present both in citations and quotes.
This observation is also found when comparing against an additional background of Springer published last authors (Supplemental Figure XX)
](https://github.com/nrosed/nature_news_disparities/raw/09df81eac6d8450127552f0b9dd3a6c1212b10eb/figure_notebooks/tmp_files/fig3_tmp/fig3_main.png "Figure 3"){#fig:fig3}


To identify possible bias in name origin, we again used the extracted quoted speakers and last authors published in Nature.
In addition, we also identified last authors of all articles cited by a news-related article.
All processed names were then inputted into Wiki2019-LSTM and used to assign one of nine possible name origins [Methods].
A schematic of the data processing and example names is displayed in Figure @fig:fig3 a.
We divided out analysis into two parts: firstly looking at the number of cited last authors with a specific name origin over all cited last authors in a particular year.
Secondly, looking at the proportion of quotes from a speaker with a specific name origin over all quotes in a particular year.
For both analyses, we used the proportion of last authors in Nature with a specific name origin over all Nature articles in a particular year.
Additionally, in our supplemental analyses we compare against a last authorship in a random selection of Springer articles.
We find that the number of quotes greatly outnumbers the number of authors and citations (Supplemental Figure 3A), but we total number of observations per data type is larger than [XX] across all years.

In comparing the citation rate of last author name origins in news articles, we find a majority of names are Celtic/English or European, both with a citation rate between 30-40% [MORE SPECIFIC] (Figure @fig:fig3 b).
East Asian names are the next highst proportion of cited names, with 10-20% of cited last authorships [MORE SPECIFIC].
All other name origins make up less than 10% [MORE SPECIFIC] of total cited authors.
To compare against the composition of last authors in Nature, we compare the top three most frequent name origins (Figure @fig:fig3 c).
We find a slight over enrichment for Celtic/English names and a slight underenrichment for East Asian names. 
Furthermore, we find no large difference for European nor any other name origin (Figure @fig:fig3 c, Supplemental Figure 3B).
The Celtic/English overenrichment and East Asian underenrichment are similarly observed when considering our subset of Springer articles (Supplemental Figure 3C).
However, we also see a significant difference European names, with a growing overenrichment.
Additionally, we do see a significant difference in Arabic/Turkish/Persian, Hispanic, Jewish, and South Asian name freqiencies between cited authors and Springer authors, however at a lower rate than observed for both Celtic/English and East Asian.

We then sought to see if the over and under enrichment patternsof cited authors was replicated in in quoted speakers.
We found a much stronger Celtic/English over enrichment, with quotes from Celtic/English speakers at a much higher frequency than even quotes from European speakers (Figure @fig:fig3 c).
Additionally, we also found a much stronger underenrichment of quotes from East Asian speakers (Figure @fig:fig3 c), with less than 10% of quotes in comparison to between 10-20% of cited authors in the same set of articles.
When we again compare against the Nature last authorship, find the same patterns observed in the previously described citation analysis with all name origins except for East Asian and Celtic/English closely matching the background rate.
Similarly, we find the same patterns in quoted speakers when comparing against the Springer background as we did in the previous citation analysis (Supplemental Figure 3E).

### Country Representation may be driven by either Science taking place in the country or science relating to that country

**Type of country representation in news articles differs depending on whether the country is talking or is talked about**
Panel A, left, depicts an example of the country mentions extracted from the news article text and citations found within news articles, as well as author affiliations in research articles.
Panel A, right, highlights the data types and processed used to analyze the countries cited or mentioned.
Panels B depicts the citation rate of the top ten most cited countries over time.
Panel C depicts the citation rate of the top three most cited countries (yellow) in comparison the that countries citation rate, as measured by author affiliation.
Pandel D is a heatmap depicting the yearly difference in citation and mention rate for a specific country.
Only countries with a consistent and significant difference over all years were depicted.
Each cell contains the difference between citation and mention rates, with red denoting lower difference between mention and citation, and green a larger difference.
The left annotation bar titled "median_M_C", is the median difference over all observed years. 
The "Class" annotation column denotes the binarized class definition of each country, either "Cited" or "Mentioned".
Panel E shows the top 15 words, extracted from articles mentioning the countries depicted in Panel D, with the largest proportional frequency between the two defined country classes.
The width of the bar depicts the log10(Frequency in Mentions / Frequency of Citations).

After identifying name origin differences in cited and quoted persons, we wanted to identify if countries 1) are represented at difference rates 2) vary in the way scientific content is related to a country.
To do this analysis we used three sources of information 1) country-related entities mentioned in the news text 2) country affiliations of cited authors in news articles 3) country affiliation of authors in Nature and Springer.
Examples of the input data and scematic of analysis is shown in figure @fig:fig4 a, with further processing details provided in [Methods].
First we interrogated the country affiliations of cited authors.
We analyzed a total of XX articles and considered all authors within the article and their affiliations for this analysis.
We found that most cited articles have at least one author with an affiliation within the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, and France (Figure @fig:fig4 b).
Interestingly, we found a strong citation overenrichment of many of the top cited countries, but we found no evidence of underenrichment by East Asian countries (Figure @fig:fig4 c, Supplemental Figure 4A).

After identifying that the citation rates of countries varied, we wondered whether this also matched the rate at which a country was talked about within the news article.
Speecifically, we were interested in identifying if there exists differences in the the type of a countries' scientific representation.
For example, we wanted to identify if a country was being talked about (i.e. their scientific policies, environment, pollution) or whether the science within a country was represented.
To do this, we calculated the citation and mention rate of each country and identified countries that had a consistent skew towards either a higher or lower mention rate (Figure @fig:fig4 d and Supplemental Figure 4B).
This allowed us to identify two classes of countries: high relative citation to mention rate: Germany, Netherlands, Japan, Spain, Denmark, Israel, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, China, South Korean, and Australia; low relative citation to mention rate: Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Brasil, Philippines, Colombia,  and India.
To then identify how these two classes of countries were talked about, we analyzed all of the main text from articles that mentioned, but did not cite each of the identified countries.
After proper identification of high frequency words across the entire corpus, we identified the top 15 most discriminative words of each country type [Methods].
Interestingly, we identified that the top 15 word most representative of countries mentioned more were closely related to environmental topics with the top 5 terms being rainforest, pesticide, dams, plantations, and deforestation (Figure @fig:fig4 e, Supplemental Figure 4C and D).
In contrast, we find that the top 5 words most related to countries with a higher citation than mention rate, were more related to biological or medical terms, with the top five terms being parkinsons, classical, epigenetic, mitochondrial, and yeast.
