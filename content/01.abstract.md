## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Scientific news coverage shapes the public’s view of the current state of scientific findings and legitimizes experts.
Through researching a story, journalists identify and interview a limited number of sources.
These sources may come from a journalist’s research or through recommendations by other scientists.
In either case, unconscious biases may influence who is identified as an expert to interview, possibly skewing the selection of interviewees.
We analyzed more than 16,000 news articles published by _Nature_ to quantify possible disparities.
Our analysis considered three possible sources of bias: gender, name origin, and country affiliation.
To explore these sources of bias, we extracted cited authors’ names and affiliations, as well as extracted names of quoted speakers.
We then used the names to predict gender and name origin of the authors and speakers.
In our analysis, we found a bias towards male quotation, but quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than academic publishing.
Interestingly, we found that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the "career-features" column reaching gender parity.
Our name origin analysis found a significant over-representation of names with Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with an East Asian origin.
This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and citations, but dampened in citations.
Finally, we performed an analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that they're described in the news.
We found a set of countries that are typically mentioned in the text of the article, but whose academic output is not highly cited, and their counterpart, a set of countries that are highly cited, but not commonly mentioned.
We found that the articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more agricultural terms, whereas articles including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms.
This discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the reporting of scientific output.
