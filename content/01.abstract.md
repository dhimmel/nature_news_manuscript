## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Scientific news coverage shapes the public’s view of the current state of scientific findings and purports legitimate experts.
Through researching a story, journalists identify and interview a small number of sources.
These sources may come from a journalist’s research or through recommendations by other scientists.
In both cases, unconscious biases may influence who is identified as an expert to interview, possibly skewing the selection of interviewees.
To quantify possible biases in scientific news coverage, we analyzed over 22,000 news articles published by _Nature_.
Our analysis studied three possible sources of bias: gender, name origin, and country affiliation.
To explore these sources of bias, we extracted cited authors’ affiliations and extracted names of quoted speakers and cited authors to predict gender and name origin.
In our analysis, we found a bias towards male quotes, but it is decreasing beyond the rate of academic publishing.
Interestingly, we found that this was column-dependent, with the “career-features’ column reaching gender parity in quotes.
Our name origin analysis found a significant over-representation of names with Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with an East Asian origin.
This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and citations.
Finally, we performed an analysis to identify how the countries vary in their news description.
We found a set of countries typically discussed in the text of the article but are not highly cited and their counterpart, countries that are highly cited but not commonly mentioned.
We found that the less cited countries tend to have more agricultural terms, whereas the cited countries have broader scientific terms, indicating a possible lack of international science coverage.
