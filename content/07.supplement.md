**Benchmark Data **
Panel A, depicts the performance of gender prediction for pipeline-identified quoted speakers. 
Panel B is a histogram of the number of articles that were falsely identified to mention a country by our processing pipeline. 
Panels C shows the estimated versus true frequency of country mentions within our benchmark dataset. The red line denotes the x = y line.

**Predicted male speakers are overrepresented in news quotes when compared against _Springer_ authorship**
Panel A depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of quotes for an estimated male speaker; Yellow: Proportion of first author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer_; Dark Mustard: Proportion of last author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer_.
We observe a larger gender difference between first and last authors in _Springer_ articles, however the proportion of predicted male speakers is less than observed in _Nature_ research articles.
Panel B depicts the proportion of male quotes broken down by article type.
In all plots the colored bands represent a 95% confidence interval and the point is the median calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Predicted Celtic/English, and European name origins are the highest cited, quoted, and mentioned**
Panel A, depicts the number of quotes, mentions, citations, or research articles considered in the name origin analysis.
Panels B-E depicts the proportion of a name origin in a given dataset, citations in articles written by journalists or writers, quoted speakers or mentions.
In all plots the colored bands represent a 95% confidence interval and the point is the median calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Over-representation of predicted Celtic/English and under-representation of East Asian name origins is also found in _Nature_ and _Springer_ articles**
Panels A-F depicts ten plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panel A, C, and E compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Nature_ last author name origins.
Panel B, D, and F compare the citation (a), quote (c), or mention (e) rate against _Springer_ last author name origins.
Panels A and B additionally partition the citation rates calculated into two sets, journalist-written articles (salmon) and scientist-written articles (mint green).
For C-F, only journalist written articles are considered.

**Analysis of Country representation**
Panel A, depicts the citation rate for the top ten most cited articles by _Nature_ news.
Each plot is a comparison between the citation rate (yellow), _Nature_ author affiliation (grey), and _Springer_ author affiliations (dark mustard).
Panel B depicts the top and bottom 5% of (mention rate - citation rate).
Each point represents a country - year pair.
Blue points are a country that is further considered to be a "Citation" or "Mention" country.
Panel C and D show the overall word frequencies of the 15 words with the largest ratio of frequencies between "Citation" (panel C) and "Mention" (panel D) countries.
