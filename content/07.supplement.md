**Benchmark Data **
Panel A, depicts the performance of gender prediction for pipeline-identified quoted speakers. 
Panel B is a histogram of the number of articles that were falsely identified to mention a country by our processing pipeline. 
Panels C shows the estimated versus true frequency of country mentions within our benchmark dataset. The red line denotes the x = y line.

**Male bias is also observed in news quotes when compared against _Springer_ authorship**
Panel A depicts three trend lines: Purple: Proportion of quotes for an estimated male speaker; Yellow: Proportion of first author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer_; Dark Mustard: Proportion of last author articles from an estimated male author in _Springer_.
We observe a larger gender difference between first and last authors in _Springer_ articles, however the over male bias is less than observed in _Nature_ research articles.
Panel B depicts the proportion of male quotes broken down by article type.
In all plots the colored bands represent a 95% confidence interval and the point is the median calculated from 5,000 bootstrap samples.

**Overrepresentation of Celtic/English names and underrepresentation of East Asian names is also found in _Springer_ articles**
Panel A, depicts the number of quotes, citations, or reasearch articles considered in the name origin analysis.
Panels B-D depicts ten plots, each for a possible name origin comparison against a background set.
Panel B and C compare the citation rate against _Nature_ (b), or _Springer_ (c) last author name origins.
Panel D and E compare the quote rate against _Nature_ (d), or _Springer_ (e) last author name origins.

**Analysis of Country representation**
Panel A, depicts the citation rate for the top ten most cited articles by _Nature_ news.
Each plot is a comparison between the citation rate (yellow), _Nature_ author affiliation (grey), and _Springer_ author affiliations (dark mustard).
Panel B depicts the top and bottom 5% of (mention rate - citation rate).
Each point represents a country - year pair.
Blue points are a country that is further considered to be a "Citation" or "Mention" country.
Panel C and D show the overall word frequencies of the 15 words with the largest ratio of frequencies between "Citation" (panel C) and "Mention" (panel D) countries.
