## Introduction
 
Scientific news coverage is an indispensible part of scientific communication to the public and provides an easily accessible way for everyone to benefit from new scientific findings.
However, it is important to identify the ways in which its coverage may skew towards particular demographics. 
News coverage of science shapes who is considered a scientist and field expert by both peers and the public.
This indication of legitimacy can either help recognize persons who are typically overlooked due to systemic biases or intensify biases.
Journalistic biases in general-interest, online and printed news have been observed by journalists themselves [@https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/enduring-whiteness-of-american-journalism; @https://medium.com/ladybits-on-medium/i-analyzed-a-year-of-my-reporting-for-gender-bias-and-this-is-what-i-found-a16c31e1cdf#.44nchdhay; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/], as well as by independent researchers [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @doi:10.1177/0163443711418272; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434; @https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change/; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports/].
Researchers found a gap between male and female subjects or sources, with independent studies finding that between 17-40% of total subjects were female across multiple general-interest printed news outlets between 1985 and 2015 [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports/].
One study found 27-35% of total subjects in international science and health related news were female between 1995 and 2015, and 46% in print, radio, and television in the United States in 2015 [@https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports/].
It should be noted that scientific news coverage is confounded by the existing differences in gender and racial demographics within the scientific field [@https://ncses.nsf.gov/wmpd; @doi:10.1038/s41590-019-0470-6].
However, we are interested in quantifying the additional level of bias beyond observed demographic differences in the scientific field, using authorship as an estimate for the existing demographic differences. 
This is similar to other studies that have quantified gender or racial disparities in science as observed in citation [@doi:10.1177/2378023117738903; @doi:10.1038/504211a] and funding rates [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.011; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaz4868; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw7238; @doi:10.1126/science.1165878; @doi:10.1126/science.1196783].

<!-- CUT It is crucial to ensure that science news coverage does not solely focus on a few well-known scientists, but expands our shared view of an expert scientist. -->
Even if science news coverage simply reflects the current scientific events and new findings, there are many gender, racial, or regional biases that can unknowingly seep into coverage.
In researching a story, a journalist will typically interview multiple sources for their opinion, potentially asking for additional sources, thus allowing individual unconscious biases at any point along the interview chain to skew scientific coverage broadly.
In addition, the repeated selection of a small set of field experts or the approach a journalist takes in establishing a new source may intensify existing biases [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/].
 
While disparities in representation may go unnoticed in a single article, analyzing a large corpus of articles can identify and quantify these disparities and help guide institutional and individual self-reflection.
In the same vein as previous media studies [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @doi:10.1177/0163443711418272; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434; @https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change/; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2015-reports/], we sought to quantify gender and regional differences of news coverage beyond the existing demographic differences in the scientific field.
Our study focused solely on scientific news content, specifically news content published by _Nature_.
Since _Nature_ also publishes primary research articles, we used these data to determine the demographics of the expected set of possible sources.
Specifically, we identified quoted and cited persons by analyzing the content and citations within all news articles from 2005 to 2020, and compared this demographic to the academic publishing demographic by analyzing first and last authorship statistics across all _Nature_ research articles during the same time period.
 
Through our analysis of 22,001 news-related articles, we were able to identify >100,000 quotes and >8,000 citations with sufficient speaker or author information within the news content.
We also identified first and last authors of >13,000 _Nature_ research articles. <!-- check number -->
We then identified possible gender or regional differences using the extracted names.
The extracted names were used to generate three data-types: quoted, mentioned, and cited persons.
We used computational methods to predict gender and identified a trend towards quotes from males in news articles when compared to both the general population and male authorship in research articles.
Within the period that we examined, the proportion of predicted male attributed quotes in news articles went from initially higher to currently lower than the proportion of male first and last authors in _Nature_.
Furthermore, we found that the quote difference was dependent on article type; the “Career Feature” column achieved gender parity in quoted speakers.
We also used computational methods to predict name origins and found a significant over-representation of names with Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with an East Asian origin in both quotes and citations.
 
While we focused on scientific news coverage from _Nature_, our software can be repurposed to analyze other news text.
We hope that news publishers will welcome bias-audting systems to help identify journalistic blind spots.
However, auditing is only part of the solution; journalists and source recommenders must also change their source gathering patterns.
To help change these patterns, there exist guides [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/], databases [@https://gage.500womenscientists.org/, @https://www.womensmediacenter.com/shesource/], and affinity groups [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/] that can help us all expand our vision of who can be a field expert.
