## Introduction
 
News coverage of science shapes what both peers and the public consider a scientist and field expert.
This indication of legitimacy can either help recognize persons who are typically overlooked due to systemic biases or intensify biases.
Journalistic biases have been previously observed by journalists themselves [@https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/enduring-whiteness-of-american-journalism; @https://medium.com/ladybits-on-medium/i-analyzed-a-year-of-my-reporting-for-gender-bias-and-this-is-what-i-found-a16c31e1cdf#.44nchdhay; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/], as well as by independent researchers [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @doi:10.1177/0163443711418272; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434; https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/lack-of-female-sources-in-new-york-times-stories-spotlights-need-for-change/; https://wmc.3cdn.net/ae1a5542872fc8810b_5tm62xgrd.pdf; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0148434].
Researchers found a gap between male and female speakers or quotes, with independent studies finding that between 17-40% of total subjects were female across multiple news outlets between 1985-2010 [@doi:10.1177/0003122415596999; @doi:10.1080/1461670X.2013.834149; @https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2010-reports/].
For science-related news, one study found 27-32% of total subjects were female between 1995-2010 [@https://whomakesthenews.org/gmmp-2010-reports/].
However, news coverage is not the only source of bias.
Both gender and racial disparities already exist in science as aboserved in differences in citation [@doi:10.1177/2378023117738903; @doi:10.1038/504211a], funding [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.011; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaz4868; @doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw7238; @doi:10.1126/science.1165878], and publication rates [@doi:10.1007/s11192-012-0893-4; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1915378117; @doi:10.1257/pandp.20181111].
 
Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that science coverage does not solely focus on a few well-known scientists but expands our shared view of an expert scientist.
One may believe that science coverage would simply reflect the most current and groundbreaking findings. 
Still, there are many ways gender, racial, or regional biases can unknowingly seep into coverage.
In researching a story, a journalist will typically identify multiple scientists for their opinion or ask for additional sources, allowing for an individual's unconscious biases to skew scientific coverage.
In addition, the repeated selection of a small set of field experts or the approach a journalist takes in establishing a new source may intensify existing biases [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/].
 
While these biases may be unconscious to an individual, identifying and quantifying these biases across a large corpus of articles is possible and can help guide institutional and individual self-reflection.
In the same vein as previous media studies, we seek to quantify gender and regional biases of news coverage.
Our study focuses solely on scientific news content, specifically news content published by Nature, as this provides a natural estimated background rate derived from research articles within Nature.
Our goal is to identify quoted and cited scientists by analyzing the content and citations within all news articles from 2005-2020.
We further analyze if the coverage is biased beyond the current state of academic publishing by analyzing the authorship statistics across all Nature research articles across the same period.
 
Through our analysis of 22,094 news-related articles, we were able to identify the XX quoted speakers and XX cited authors.
We then identified possible gender or regional biases using the extracted names.
Similarly, as a comparator, we used the names of Nature research authors.
From the names of authors or quoted speakers, we used genderizeR [@https://github.com/kalimu/genderizeR] to obtain a binary gender prediction and Wiki-2019LSTM [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251] to predict a name origin.
Using the gender predictions, we identified a bias towards male quotes in news articles. 
However, the bias is decreasing beyond the rate of academic publishing.
Furthermore, we identified that the speaker bias was dependent on article type; the "Career-Feature" column achieved gender parity in quoted speakers.
We identified a significant over-representation of names with Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with an East Asian origin in both quotes and citations from the name origin predictions.
 
When identifying the regional biases of scientific coverage, we sought to quantify if countries differed in the content of their news coverage.
To do this, we first identified the citation and mention rates for each country, using the news article text and associated citations.
We were able to separate countries into two classes from this quantification: high or low citation-to-mention rate.
This calculated rate allows us to distinguish if the countries current state or its science was the subject of a countries coverage.
We identified that countries with a high citation-to-mention rate (top three: Germany, Netherlands, Japan) had more scientific words specifically associated with them than countries with the lowest citation-to-mention rate.
Furthermore, we find that countries with a low citation-to-mention rate (bottom three: India, Colombia, Philippines) had more environmental words associated explicitly with them.
