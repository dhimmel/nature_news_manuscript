## Discussion
 
Scientific news coverage, unlike academic articles, should represent not only the current state of research-related disciplines but also the diversity of its readership.
News coverage is the conduit between the academic and public spheres, and consequently shapes the public's view of science and scientists.
Though it would be best for news coverage to promote equitable representation, at a minimum news coverage should match the current rates of regional and gender participation in academia.
To test whether this last point was true, we analyzed over 10,000 news articles published by Nature to identify quoted and cited persons.
We then compared this to the authorship statistics from Nature's research articles and a subset of Springer's English language articles.

We first looked at possible gender biases in quotes and found a large, but decreasing, gender gap in all but one article type.
We found that the decreasing trend was largely driven by a single column, career-feature.
This column has an equal number of quotes from both genders showing that gender parity is possible in science-related news coverage.
In order to draw these conclusions, we performed an analysis examining the proportion of all identified quotes that were from a male speaker.
As a comparator, we analyzed the proportion of male authors, which similarly is a measure of scientific participation.
Using computational methods, we performed quote association and gender prediction.
We observe a strong bias towards male participation across both authorship and quotes.
We also identify a gender bias between first and last authors, previously shown in [CITE].
Interestingly, we found that while the rate of male quotes and male authorship are decreasing over time, quotation rate is decreasing faster than authorship rates.
We then tried to identify what drove the observed trend.
First or last authorship changes, which we anticipated to affect gendered quotation rates, did not drive the downward trend.
Despite first authors more commonly being female than last authors, first and last authors were quoted at comparable rates over time.
Instead, we found that column types were driving the trend, with career-feature reaching gender parity.
 
To further our analysis of possible coverage biases, we looked to biases in name origins of quoted and cited last authors across all the processed news articles.
Our findings provide additional support for previous studies that identified under-citation [CITE??] and under-recognition [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251] of East Asian persons.
We find that most quotes and citations are from persons with Celtic/English or European name origins, followed by East Asian, with the remaining individual origins making up less than 10% of both citations or quotes.
Except Celtic/English and East Asian, all name origins roughly match the expected academic background rate estimated by Nature last authorship.
We find a clear over-representation of Celtic/English names and under-representation of East Asian names.
We also found this same pattern in our Springer data set.
 
After observing name origin biases, we sought to identify a bias in the frequency or content of coverage across countries.
We first looked at possible citation biases for authors with specific country affiliations, and found that most manuscripts cited by Nature news have at least one author affiliated with the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.
In contrast to the name origins results, the citation rate of Chinese affiliated authors was not significantly depleted.
Interestingly, we find the number of citations to articles with authors having affiliations in China is increasing at the same rate as Springer and Nature authorships.
Furthermore, the increased citation and last authorship rates of Chinese affiliated authors is most pronounced in comparison to all other countries within the top ten most cited. 

We then focused on identifying whether the news content about a country focused on the scientific output from that country or the country itself as the scientific subject.
We postulated that a difference in citation and mention rates could indicate the difference in a news article’s subject matter.
To achieve this, we identified two sets of countries with a large and consistent difference in their citation and mention rates.
The top "Citation" countries were Germany, Netherlands, and Japan.
The top "Mention" countries were India, Colombia, and the Philippines.
We then found that these two sets of countries were discussed differently.
The resultant words for "Mention" countries were most related to agriculture; suggesting that the country was likely the article’s subject.
In contrast, the representative words for "Citation" countries were more diverse in topic, relating to biological, medical, and physics terms.
The difference in discriminative terms between the two country sets is evidence that the news content may focus more on research of a country as a subject than science that comes out of it.

 
Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to identify how news coverage varies by country, name origin, and gender, and compare it to scientific publishing background rates.
While we found a significant gender bias, the rate of female representation in scientific news is increasing and outpacing authorships on scientific manuscripts.
Furthermore, we identified a significant depletion of quotes from scientists with an East Asian name origin and a significant but smaller depletion of authors with an East Asian name origin among the citations of news content.
Finally, we showed that coverage of specific countries might be biased by content, with the country’s scientific output being put in a more significant focus for some countries than the environmental aspects of other countries.
Previous anecdotal studies from journalists have shown that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it [CITE].
Once a bias is identified an individual can seek resources to help them find and retain diverse sources, such as utilizing international expert databases like gage [@https://gage.500womenscientists.org/] and SheSource [@https://www.womensmediacenter.com/shesource/].
Additional tips for journalists to acheive and maintain a diverse source pool is described by Christina Selby in the Open Notebook [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/].

While removing biases from their coverage should be a focus for editors and journalists, many journalists are limited by the persons who can respond to their requests for an interview or leads from prominent scientists [CITE].
Scientists themselves can also recommend junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, in contrast to referring journalists to well-established researchers that may already receive a lot of representation.
In addition, many journalists can provide more equitable ways to respond to interview opportunities [CITE, expand]
Furthermore, since news coverage is accountable to their readership, it presents the opportunity to represent scientific perspectives that are more diverse than observed in academic publishing.
[ADD SENTENCE, something like "Academic publishing has been shown to be XXX CITE"]
News outlets and referee scientists have a unique opportunity to shape the public and their peers’ perspectives on who is a scientific expert.
Their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could reflect a more diverse view of science and scientists and help to diminish existing biases in scientific research.
