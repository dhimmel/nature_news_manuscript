## Discussion

Scientific news coverage, unlike academic articles, is beholden not only reflect the current state of research, but also of its readership.
In addition, their coverage shapes the publics view of science and scientists.
It should be expected that their articles at least match the current academic rates of regional and gender biases.
To test whether this was true, we analyzed over 10,000 news articles published by Nature to identify who was quoted and cited.
We then compared this to the authorship statistics from Nature's research articles and a subset of Springer's english language articles.
We first looked at possible gender biases by looking at the proportion of all identified quotes were from a male speaker.
While we could have analyzed the proportion of all quotes that came from a male speaker, we were interested in measuring the overall participation rates by gender.
As a comparator, we analyzed the proportion of all authors that were male, which similarly is a measure of scientific participation.
Quotes association and gender predition were done using computational methods.
In addition to prediction or processing bias, we only allow binary gender predictions which adds an additional source of error.
While this pipeline will contain incideental and systematic errors, we believe that our observed signal greatly outweighs the observed bias in our predictions (Supplemental Figure 1 a).

We observe a strong bias towards male participation across both authorship and quotes (Figure @fig:fig2 c).
We also identify a gender bias between first and last authors, which has been previously shown in [CITE].
Interestingly, we found that the rate of male quotes to be higher than authoship in 2005, but is decreasing at a faster pace over time.
In comparing against Nature authorship, quotes matched the rate of male last authorship in 2010, matching male first authorship rates in 2018, and continuing to decrease.
While the proportion of male quotes is still far from parity, with 70.1% (3911/5578) of 2020 quotes coming from a male speaker, it is clear that there is an accelerating move towards parity.
To identify what this trend is driven by, we first checked if it was driven by a shift in quotes from last to first authors (Figure @fig:fig2 d).
We found a stable and slight bias towards last authors, which was recapitulated in our Springer data set, indicating that it was unlikely driven by quotes from an increasing number of first authors.
We next wanted to determine if this was an column-type effect, e.g. do differing types of articles have different biases.
Figure @fig:fig2 e and Supplemental Figure 2b clearly show that one article type, career-feature, has equal number of quotes from both genders showing that gender parity is possible in science related news coverage.
Furthermore, we additionally find an accelerating downwards trend across the other article types with sufficient number of quotes observed.

To further our analysis of possible coverage biases, we then looked to biases in name origins of quoted and cited persons across all the processed news articles.
Cited persons consist of all last authors of articles cited in a nature news article.
For our comparisons, we again used the same names used for the gender analysis, from both Nature and Springer.
For this analysis, we also decided to focus on last authorship in our comparative data sets.
Names were assigned one name origin, based upon the highest probability of assignment as output from the Wiki2019-LSTM trained model [CITE].
This model predicts a probability of assignment across ten possible origins: Celtic/English, European, East Asian, Arabic/Turkish/Persian, Jewish, Hispanic, African, South East Asian, Nordic and Greek. 
In the original publications experiments, they found a minimum of [XX] accuracy, which we find to be an acceptable level of error, especially since our observed signal it much larger than the expected error.
We find a that a majority of quotes and citations are from persons with Celtic/English or European name origins, followed by East Asian, with the remaining individual origins making up less than 10% of both citations or quotes.
All name origins, except Celtic/English and East Asian, roughly match the expected academic background rate as estimated by Nature last authorship (Figure @fig:fig3 c, Supplemental Figure 3 b).
We find a very clear over representation of Celtic/English names and under representation of East Asian names, which was also found in our Springer data set comparison (Supplemental Figure 3 c).
This recapitulates the findings of East Asian persons being undercited [CITE] and recieving fewer awards [CITE].

After observation of name origin biases, we sought to identify if there was additionally a bias which countries that were covered and if there exist any differences in how they were covered.
To do this, we needed to analyse both which countries were mentioned in a news article and the affiliations of scientists cited in news articles.
For our comparisons, we again used the same names used for the gender analysis, from both Nature and Springer.
However, for this analysis we assigned an affiliation to a manuscript is any author has an affiliation from a specific country, so a single manuscript may have multiple country affiliations.
This was done because results from the Springer API only return all country affiliations for a specific manuscript and are not affiliated to a specific author.
We first looked at possible citation biases for authors with specific country affiliations.
We found that most manuscripts cited by Nature news have at least one author with an affiliation from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.
In contrast to the name origins analysis shown previously, we identified that the citation rate of China was not significantly under enriched by citation.
Interestingly, we find the the number of citation affiliated with China are increasing at the same rate in comparison to Springer and Nature authorships.
This differs from all other countries within the top ten most cited, where there is no large change in Nature authorship, however there is an increase in the articles cited by Nature news.
We speculate that it is possible that research articles that are covered in the news, are larger pieces of work that include international collaborations. 

After analyzing the country affiliations of cited countries, we analyzed the rates at which a country is mentioned.
We postulated that a difference in citation and mention rate could indicate the difference between a country being talked about in a scientific way versus a the science from a country being represented.
To do this, we must first quantified the mention rate of a country.
First to identify is a country was mentioned in an article, we took all organizations, countries, states, or provinces identified by coreNLP's named entity tagger.
We then took all the identified region-related named entitites, and utilized Open Street Map in order to get the affiliated country.
Since there may be errors in both coreNLP and Open Street Map, a country is only assumed to be mentioned when there is at least two unique entities that map to the same country in a single article.
On a benchmark set, this results in an class-balanced error of [XX] across all countries (Supplemental Figure 1 b).
To compare the citation and mention rates, we took the per country difference for each year and identified countries that were in the top or bottom 5% of the difference per year.
After this, we removed all countries that were in both the top or bottom 5% in different years, thus excluding the United States and United Kingdom from consideration. [List all fo them]
The remaining countries were then divided into two classes, "Citation" and "Mention" countries based upon the median difference across all years.
The top "Citation" countries were Germany, Netherlands, and Japan.
The top "Mention" countries were India, Colombia, and the Philippines.
To identify if these two classes of countries were being talked about differently, i.e. science from the country vs. science of the country, we took the text of all articles that mentioned the identified countries, but did not cite an author with an affiliation from that country.
We then identified the top words with the largest ratio difference between the country normalized frequency between the two country classes. 
The resultant words for "Mention" countries were most related to agriculture, indicating that these countries were most likely being talked about.
In contrast, the representative words for "Citation" countries were more diverse in topic, relating to to biological, medical, and physics terms.
This is evidence that some countries, while they may be talked about at a high rate, can differ in the way in which they are talked about, focusing more on research of the country than science that comes out of a country.


Through our comprehensive analysis we were able to identify how news coverage varies by country, name origin, and gender as well as compare it to scientific publishing background rates.
While we were able to identify a significant gender bias, we found that the rate of female representation is increasing and outpacing the scientific publishing field.
Furthermore, we identified that there is a significant bias against coverage from those with an East Asian name origin.
Finally, we showed that coverage of specific countries may be biased by content, with the scientific output of a country in larger focus for some countries, in comparison to the envinromental aspects of other countries.
It has been show through previous anecdotal studies from journalists, that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it [CITE].
While the removal of biases from their coverage should be a focus for editors and journalists, many journalists are limited by the persons who are able to respond to their requests for an interview or leads from prominent scientists [CITE].
Scientists themselves can also work to recommend junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, in contrast to referring journalists to well-established researchers that may already recieve a lot of representation.
In addition, many journalists can provide more equitable ways to respond for interview opportunities [CITE, expand]
Furthermore, since news coverage is beholden to their readership, it presents the opportunity to represent scientific perspecitives that are more diverse than observed in academic publishing.
[ADD SENTENCE, something like "Academic publishing has been shown to be XXX CITE"]
This presents a unique opportunity for news outlets and referee scientists, that their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could reflect a more diverse view of science and scientists than what purely academic publications can currently provide.
