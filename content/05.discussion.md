## Discussion
 
Scientific news coverage, unlike academic articles, is accountable to reflecting not only the current state of research, but also the diversity of its readership.
News coverage is the conduit between the academic and public spheres, and consequently shapes the public's view of science and scientists.
At a minimum, news coverage should match the current academic rates of regional and gender biases.
To test whether this last point was true, we analyzed over 10,000 news articles published by Nature to identify quoted and cited persons.
We then compared this to the authorship statistics from Nature's research articles and a subset of Springer's English language articles.

We first looked at possible gender biases by examining the proportion of all identified quotes that were from a male speaker.
As a comparator, we analyzed the proportion of male authors, which similarly is a measure of scientific participation.
Using computational methods, we performed quote association and gender prediction.
We observe a strong bias towards male participation across both authorship and quotes.
We also identify a gender bias between first and last authors, previously shown in [CITE].
Interestingly, we found that while the rate of male quotes and male authorship are decreasing over time, quotation rate is decreasing faster than authorship rates.
We then tried to identify what drove the observed trend.
First or last authorship changes, which we anticipated to affect gendered quotation rates, did not drive the downward trend.
Despite first authors more commonly being female than last authors, first and last authors were quoted at comparable rates over time.
Instead, column types were driving the trend.
Our analysis shows that one article type, career-feature, has an equal number of quotes from both genders showing that gender parity is possible in science-related news coverage.
 
To further our analysis of possible coverage biases, we looked to biases in name origins of quoted and cited last authors persons across all the processed news articles.
We find that most quotes and citations are from persons with Celtic/English or European name origins, followed by East Asian, with the remaining individual origins making up less than 10% of both citations or quotes.
Except Celtic/English and East Asian, all name origins roughly match the expected academic background rate estimated by Nature last authorship.
We find a clear over-representation of Celtic/English names and under-representation of East Asian names.
We also found this same pattern in our Springer data set.
Our findings reiterate previous studies that identified under-citation [CITE??] and under-recognition [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251] of East Asian persons.
 
After observing name origin biases, we sought to identify a bias in the frequency or content of coverage across countries.
To do this, we needed to analyze both which countries were mentioned in a news article and the affiliations of scientists cited in news articles.
We again used the same names for the gender analysis from both Nature and Springer for our comparisons.
We first looked at possible citation biases for authors with specific country affiliations, and found that most manuscripts cited by Nature news have at least one author affiliated with the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.
In contrast to the name origins analysis shown previously, we identified that the citation rate of China was not significantly under enriched by citation.
Interestingly, we find the number of citations affiliated with China is increasing at the same rate compared to Springer and Nature authorships.
The increased citation rate differs from all other countries within the top ten most cited. 
In constrast, there is no considerable change in Nature authorship but an increase in the articles cited by Nature news.
We speculate that news coverage of research articles may be biased towards more extensive and more international pieces of work.
 
After analyzing the country affiliations of cited countries, we analyzed countries’ mention rates.
We postulated that a difference in citation and mention rate could indicate the difference in a news article’s subject matter.
We then focused on identifying the news content on a country focused on the scientific output from a country or as the scientific subject.
To do this, we identified countries with a large and consistent difference in their citation and mention rates.

We divided the resultant countries into two sets, "Citation" and "Mention" countries, based upon the median difference in citations versus mentions across all years.
The top "Citation" countries were Germany, Netherlands, and Japan.
The top "Mention" countries were India, Colombia, and the Philippines.
To identify if these two sets of countries were being discussed differently, i.e., science *from* the country vs. science *of* the country, we took the text of all articles mentioned, but did not have a cited affiliation with, the identified countries.
We then identified the top words with the greatest ratio difference between the country normalized frequency between the two country sets.
The resultant words for "Mention" countries were most related to agriculture; this indicates that the country was likely the article’s subject.
In contrast, the representative words for "Citation" countries were more diverse in topic, relating to biological, medical, and physics terms.
The difference in discriminative terms between the two country sets is evidence that some countries differ in how they are discussed.
The news content may focus more on the research of the country than science that comes out of a nation.
 
 
Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to identify how news coverage varies by country, name origin, and gender and compare it to scientific publishing background rates.
While we were able to identify a significant gender bias, we found that the rate of female representation is increasing and outpacing the scientific publishing field.
Furthermore, we identified a significant bias against coverage from those with an East Asian name origin.
Finally, we showed that coverage of specific countries might be biased by content, with the country’s scientific output being put in a more significant focus for some countries than the environmental aspects of other countries.
Previous anecdotal studies from journalists have shown that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it [CITE].
Once a bias is identified an individual can seek resources to help them find and retain diverse sources, such as utilizing international expert databases like gage [@https://gage.500womenscientists.org/] and SheSource [@https://www.womensmediacenter.com/shesource/].
Additional tips for journalists to acheive and maintain a diverse source pool is described by Christina Selby in the Open Notebook [https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/].

While removing biases from their coverage should be a focus for editors and journalists, many journalists are limited by the persons who can respond to their requests for an interview or leads from prominent scientists [CITE].
Scientists themselves can also recommend junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, in contrast to referring journalists to well-established researchers that may already receive a lot of representation.
In addition, many journalists can provide more equitable ways to respond to interview opportunities [CITE, expand]
Furthermore, since news coverage is accountable to their readership, it presents the opportunity to represent scientific perspectives that are more diverse than observed in academic publishing.
[ADD SENTENCE, something like "Academic publishing has been shown to be XXX CITE"]
News outlets and referee scientists have a unique opportunity to shape the public and their peers’ perspectives on who is a scientific expert.
Their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could reflect a more diverse view of science and scientists and help to diminish existing biases in scientific research.
