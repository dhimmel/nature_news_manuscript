## Discussion
 
Scientific news coverage ideally is representative of academic articles.
News coverage is the conduit between the academic and public spheres, and consequently shapes the public's view of science and scientists.
Though it would be best for news coverage to promote equitable representation, at a minimum quotes and citations would ideally match the regional and gender demographics of scientific academia.
To examine this last point, we analyzed over 22,000 news articles published by _Nature_ to identify quoted, mentioned, and cited persons.
We then compared this to the authorship statistics from _Nature_'s research articles and a subset of _Springer_'s English language articles.

We first looked at possible gender biases in quotes and found a large, but decreasing, gender gap when compared to the broader population in all but one article type.
We found that the decreasing trend was largely driven by the recent introduction of a single column, "Career-Feature".
This column has an equal number of quotes from both genders, showing that gender parity is possible in science-related news coverage.
However, we do recognize that different news columns may represent different demographics and be inherently more difficult to reach parity.
In order to draw these conclusions, we analyzed the proportion of all identified quotes that were from a speaker predicted to be male compared to the proportion of authors predicted to be male, which similarly is a measure of scientific participation.
Using computational methods, we performed quote association and gender prediction.
We observed a strong bias towards predicted male participation across both authorship and quotes.
We also identify a gender bias between first and last authors, as previously shown [@pubmed:30070216; @doi:10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2020.05.020; @doi:10.1016/j.biopsych.2019.02.010].
 
To further our analysis of possible coverage biases, we looked to biases in name origins of quoted and cited last authors across all the processed news articles.
Our findings provide additional support for previous studies that identified under-citation [@doi:10.1101/2020.10.12.336230] and under-recognition [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251] of East Asian persons.
Interestingly, we found under-citation of persons with East Asian name origins to be much less pronounced than under-quotation.
We do not believe that the under-quotation is driven by paraphrasing sources, which may occur more frequently with non-native English speakers.
This is because our findings of under-enrichment of predicted East Asian name origins was recapitulated when we additionally looked at unique names mentioned within news articles.
Furthermore, we find that scientist-written news articles tend to under-cite persons with East Asian name origins more than journalist-written articles.
Our finding of under-quotation of East Asian persons was also recapitulated when we additionally looked at unique names mentioned within news articles.
Overall, we find that most quotes, mentions, and citations are from persons with Celtic/English or European name origins, followed by East Asian, with the remaining origins individually making up less than 10% of both citations or quotes.
Except Celtic/English (over-representation) and East Asian (under-representation), all name origins roughly match the expected academic background rate estimated by _Nature_ last authorship.
We also found this same pattern in our _Springer_ data set.
 
After observing name origin biases, we determined if there is a bias in the frequency or content of coverage across countries.
We first looked at possible citation biases for authors with specific country affiliations, and found that most manuscripts cited by _Nature_ news-related articles have at least one author affiliated with the United States, United Kingdom, or Germany.
In contrast to the name origins results, the citation rate of Chinese affiliated authors was not significantly depleted.
Interestingly, we find the number of citations to articles with authors having affiliations in China is increasing at the same rate as _Springer_ and _Nature_ authorships.
Furthermore, the increased citation and last authorship rates of Chinese affiliated authors is most pronounced in comparison to all other countries within the top ten most cited. 

We then focused on identifying whether the news-related content about a country focused on the scientific output from that country or the country itself as the scientific subject.
We postulated that a difference in citation and mention rates could indicate the difference in a news article's subject matter.
To achieve this, we identified two sets of countries with a large and consistent difference in their citation and mention rates.
The top "Citation" countries were Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands.
The top "Mention" countries were India, the United States, and Colombia.
We then found that these two sets of countries were discussed differently.
The resultant words for "Mention" countries were most related to extraction, agriculture and politics, suggesting that the country was likely the article's subject.
In contrast, the representative words for "Citation" countries were more diverse in topic, relating to biological, medical, and physics terms.
We hypothesize that the difference in discriminative terms between the two country sets is evidence that the news content may focus more on research of a country as a subject than science that comes out of it.
This hypothesis assumes that no country has a specialization in a scientific topic, which is likely not true.
This does, however, give us an indication that countries differ in their scientific news coverage.
 
 
Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to identify how news coverage varies by country, name origin, and gender, and compare it to scientific publishing background rates.
While we found a significant gender bias, the rate of female representation in scientific news is increasing and outpacing authorships on scientific manuscripts.
Furthermore, we identified a significant depletion of quotes from scientists with an East Asian name origin when compared to primary research authorship, and a significant but smaller depletion of authors with an East Asian name origin among the citations in news content.
Finally, we showed that coverage of specific countries differ in content, with the country's scientific output being put in a more significant focus for some countries than the environmental aspects of other countries.

Previous anecdotal studies from journalists have shown that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it [@https://medium.com/ladybits-on-medium/i-analyzed-a-year-of-my-reporting-for-gender-bias-and-this-is-what-i-found-a16c31e1cdf; @https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/gender-diversity-journalism/463023/; @https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/i-spent-two-years-trying-to-fix-the-gender-imbalance-in-my-stories/552404/].
Once a bias is identified an individual can seek resources to help them find and retain diverse sources, such as utilizing international expert databases like gage [@https://gage.500womenscientists.org/] and SheSource [@https://www.womensmediacenter.com/shesource/].
Additional tips for journalists to achieve and maintain a diverse source pool is described by Christina Selby in the Open Notebook [@https://www.theopennotebook.com/2016/08/23/including-diverse-voices-in-science-stories/].

While removing biases from their coverage should be a focus for editors and journalists, many journalists are limited by the persons who can respond to their requests for an interview or leads from prominent scientists.
Scientists can also audit themselves to ensure that not only are they referring field experts to journalists, but are also not allowing their biases to influence the experts they suggest. 
<!-- Furthermore, since news coverage is accountable to their readership, it presents the opportunity to represent scientific perspectives that are more diverse than observed in academic publishing. !-->
We have shown that approaching gender parity is possible in at least one column type, as observed by the gender parity in quotes from the "Career-Features" column.
News outlets and referee scientists have a unique opportunity to shape the public and their peers' perspectives on who is a scientific expert.
Their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could help to diminish existing biases in scientific research.
