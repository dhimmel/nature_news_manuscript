## Discussion
 
Scientific news coverage, unlike academic articles, is accountable not only to reflect the current state of research but also of its readership.
In addition, their coverage shapes the publics’ view of science and scientists.
At a minimum, news coverage should match the current academic rates of regional and gender biases.
To test whether this was true, we analyzed over 10,000 news articles published by Nature to identify quoted and cited persons.
We then compared this to the authorship statistics from Nature's research articles and a subset of Springer's English language articles.
We first looked at possible gender biases by looking at the proportion of all identified quotes were from a male speaker.
While we could have analyzed the proportion of all quotes from a male speaker, we were interested in measuring the overall participation rates by gender.
As a comparator, we analyzed the proportion of male authors, which similarly is a measure of scientific participation.
Using computational methods, we performed quote association and gender prediction.
While we try to control for possible errors within our pipeline, we systematically ignore non-binary persons, which adds additional error sources.
While this pipeline will contain incidental and systematic errors, we believe that our observed signal greatly outweighs the observed bias in our predictions (Supplemental Figure 1 a).
 
We observe a strong bias towards male participation across both authorship and quotes (Figure @fig:fig2 c).
We also identify a gender bias between first and last authors, previously shown in [CITE].
Interestingly, we found that the rate of male quotes to be higher than authorship in 2005, but is decreasing faster than authorship rates over time.
In comparing against Nature authorship, quotes matched the rate of male last authorship in 2010, matching male first authorship rates in 2018 and decreasing.
While the proportion of male quotes is still far from parity, with 70.1% (3911/5578) of 2020 quotes from a male speaker, it is clear that there is an accelerating move towards equivalence.
We then tried to identify what drove the observed trend.
We first checked if a shift in quotes from last to first authors drove the trend (Figure @fig:fig2 d).
We found a stable and slight bias towards the last authors, which was recapitulated in our Springer data set, indicating that it was unlikely driven by quotes from an increasing number of first authors.
We next wanted to determine if this was a column-type effect, e.g., do differing types of articles have different biases.
Figure @fig:fig2 e and Supplemental Figure 2b clearly show that one article type, career-feature, has an equal number of quotes from both genders showing that gender parity is possible in science-related news coverage.
Furthermore, we also find an accelerating downward trend across the other article types with a sufficient number of quotes observed.
 
To further our analysis of possible coverage biases, we then looked to biases in name origins of quoted and cited persons across all the processed news articles.
Cited persons consist of all last authors of articles cited in a Nature news article.
We again used the same names used for the gender analysis from both Nature and Springer for our comparisons.
For this analysis, we also decided to focus on the last authorship in our comparative data sets.
Names were assigned one name origin, based upon the highest probability of assignment as output from the Wiki2019-LSTM trained model [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251].
This model predicts a probability of assignment across ten possible origins: Celtic/English, European, East Asian, Arabic/Turkish/Persian, Jewish, Hispanic, African, South East Asian, Nordic, and Greek.
In the original publications experiments, they found a minimum of [XX] accuracy, which we find to be an acceptable level of error, especially since our observed signal is much larger than the expected error.
We find that most quotes and citations are from persons with Celtic/English or European name origins, followed by East Asian, with the remaining individual origins making up less than 10% of both citations or quotes.
All name origins, except Celtic/English and East Asian, roughly match the expected academic background rate estimated by Nature last authorship (Figure @fig:fig3 c, Supplemental Figure 3 b).
We find a clear over-representation of Celtic/English names and under-representation of East Asian names.
We also found this same pattern in our Springer data set (Supplemental Figure 3 c).
Our findings reiterate previous studies that identified under-citation [CITE??] and under-recognition [@doi:10.1101/2020.04.14.927251] of East Asian persons.
 
After observing name origin biases, we sought to identify a bias in the frequency or content of coverage across countries.
To do this, we needed to analyze both which countries were mentioned in a news article and the affiliations of scientists cited in news articles.
We again used the same names used for the gender analysis from both Nature and Springer for our comparisons.
However, we assigned an affiliation to a manuscript for this analysis if any author has affiliation from a specific country so that a single manuscript may have multiple country affiliations.
We analyzed any possible country affiliation for an article due to limits imposed by the Springer API.
All results from the Springer API only return all country affiliations for a specific manuscript and are not affiliated to one particular author.
We first looked at possible citation biases for authors with specific country affiliations.
We found that most manuscripts cited by Nature news have at least one author affiliated with the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany.
In contrast to the name origins analysis shown previously, we identified that the citation rate of China was not significantly under enriched by citation.
Interestingly, we find the number of citation affiliated with China are increasing at the same rate in comparison to Springer and Nature authorships.
The increased citation rate differs from all other countries within the top ten most cited. 
There is no considerable change in Nature authorship but an increase in the articles cited by Nature news.
We speculate that news coverage of research articles may be biased towards larger and more international pieces of work.
 
After analyzing the country affiliations of cited countries, we analyzed countries’ mention rates.
We postulated that a difference in citation and mention rate could indicate the difference in a news article’s subject matter.
We then focused on identifying from the news content on a country focused on the scientific output from a country or as the scientific subject.
To do this, we must first quantify the mention rate of a country.
First, to identify if a country was mentioned in an article, we took all organizations, countries, states, or provinces identified by coreNLP's named entity tagger.
We then took all the identified region-related named entities and utilized OpenStreetMap to get the affiliated country.
Since there may be errors in both coreNLP and OpenStreetMap, a country is only assumed to be mentioned when at least two unique entities map to the same country in a single article.
On a benchmark set, this results in a class-balanced error of [XX] across all countries (Supplemental Figure 1 b).
To compare the citation and mention rates, we took the per country difference for each year and identified countries in the top or bottom 5% of the difference per year.
After this, we removed all countries that were in both the top or bottom 5% in different years, thus excluding the United States and the United Kingdom from consideration. [List all of them]
We then divided the remaining countries into two sets, "Citation" and "Mention" countries, based upon the median difference across all years.
The top "Citation" countries were Germany, Netherlands, and Japan.
The top "Mention" countries were India, Colombia, and the Philippines.
To identify if these two sets of countries were being discussed differently, i.e., science from the country vs. science of the country, we took the text of all articles that mentioned, but did not have a cited affiliation with, the identified countries.
We then identified the top words with the greatest ratio difference between the country normalized frequency between the two country sets.
The resultant words for "Mention" countries were most related to agriculture; this indicates that the country was likely the subject of the article.
In contrast, the representative words for "Citation" countries were more diverse in topic, relating to biological, medical, and physics terms.
The difference in discriminative terms between the two country sets is evidence that some countries differ in how they are discussed.
The news content may focus more on the research of the country than science that comes out of a nation.
 
 
Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to identify how news coverage varies by country, name origin, and gender and compare it to scientific publishing background rates.
While we were able to identify a significant gender bias, we found that the rate of female representation is increasing and outpacing the scientific publishing field.
Furthermore, we identified a significant bias against coverage from those with an East Asian name origin.
Finally, we showed that coverage of specific countries might be biased by content, with the scientific output of a country in a more significant focus for some countries than the environmental aspects of other countries.
Previous anecdotal studies from journalists have shown that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it [CITE].
While removing biases from their coverage should be a focus for editors and journalists, many journalists are limited by the persons who can respond to their requests for an interview or leads from prominent scientists [CITE].
Scientists themselves can also work to recommend junior researchers from diverse backgrounds, in contrast to referring journalists to well-established researchers that may already receive a lot of representation.
In addition, many journalists can provide more equitable ways to respond to interview opportunities [CITE, expand]
Furthermore, since news coverage is accountable to their readership, it presents the opportunity to represent scientific perspectives that are more diverse than observed in academic publishing.
[ADD SENTENCE, something like "Academic publishing has been shown to be XXX CITE"]
News outlets and referee scientists have a unique opportunity to shape the public and their peers’ perspectives on who is a scientific expert.
Their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could reflect a more diverse view of science and scientists and help to diminish existing biases in scientific research.
